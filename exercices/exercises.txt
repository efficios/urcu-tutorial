RCU exercises
Mathieu Desnoyers, October 17th, 2013


* Exercise 1

Unbalanced RCU read-side lock. Experience hang with: menu/god/create
gerbil, followed by exiting all menus, and then quitting the game (q).

Debug with gdb, explain lockup scenario.


* Exercise 2

Modify game to use call_rcu() worker thread rather than
synchronize_rcu() for reclaim.


* Exercise 3

Modify game to use QSBR (urcu-qsbr.h) flavor rather than read lock
(urcu.h) flavor.


* Exercise 4

Debug deadlock involving RCU and mutexes.
e.g.
 print_output_mutex
 -> synchronize_rcu()

 rcu_read_lock()
 -> print_output_mutex


* Exercise 5

Implement a RCU list of most recently modified animals. Last 3 animals'
key are printed in output summary (RCU read-side).
