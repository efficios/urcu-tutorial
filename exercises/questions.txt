Use game menu/god/create gerbil. Then, create snakes. Exit all menus
(back to RCU Island Summary), and wait until you observe that at least
one gerbil has been eaten. Then quit the game (q).

Can you explain and debug this lockup ?

call_rcu() worker thread rather than synchronize_rcu() for reclaim.

A deadlock has been added to this code. Can you spot it and explain the
deadlock scenario ?

Implement a RCU list of most recently born living animals. Last 3
animals' key are printed in output summary (RCU read-side).
