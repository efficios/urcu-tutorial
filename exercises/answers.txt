Answers are provided far below.

Don't go look at them before preparing your own answer! ;-)






























No cheating !  :-P









































































* Exercise 1

Use game menu/god/create gerbil. Then, create snakes. Exit all menus
(back to RCU Island Summary), and wait until you observe that at least
one gerbil has been eaten. Then quit the game (q).

Debug with gdb, lockup scenario:

Unbalanced RCU read-side lock. A reverse diff of
patches/questions/exercise1.patch gives the answer.


* Exercise 2

Modify game configuration to use call_rcu() worker thread rather than
synchronize_rcu() for reclaim.

answers/exercise2/ has the answer implemented.


* Exercise 3

Debug deadlock involving RCU and mutexes.

Thread A:
  - do_root_menu()
    - lock print_output_mutex
    - call do_config()
      - call urcu_game_config_update_end()
        - call synchronize_rcu()
        - waits for RCU read-side critical sections

Thread B:
  - output_thread_fct()
    - rcu_read_lock()
    - lock print_output_mutex

A reverse diff of patches/questions/exercise3.patch reveals the answer.


* Exercise 4

Modify game to use QSBR (urcu-qsbr.h) flavor rather than read lock
(urcu.h) flavor.

Answer implemented in answers/exercise4/


* Exercise 5

Implement a RCU list of most recently born living animals. Last 3
animals' key are printed in output summary (RCU read-side).

Answer implemented in answers/exercise5/


* Exercise 6

Diagnose a race condition. The race condition is due to a reversed order
of removal from the "all" hash table vs "per kind" hash table, not
matching the expected logic in try_birth().

Diagnosing this issue requires stress-tests: small hash table, very
frequent updates.

Answer revealed by reversed diff of patches/questions/exercise6.patch


I hope you enjoyed this training !
